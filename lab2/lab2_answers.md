1. Business Process

The main business process identified in this project is the submission of user reviews on AI note-taking applications available on the Google Play Store.

Each review represents a measurable event generated by a user at a specific point in time. The objective of the data model is to enable analytical exploration of these review events across different contextual dimensions such as application, developer, category, and time.

2. Declared Grain

The declared grain of the fact table is:

One row in the fact table represents one user review for one application at a specific point in time.

This ensures that the fact table respects a clear and consistent level of detail and avoids aggregation at the storage level.

3. Identified Dimensions

Based on the analytical requirements, the following dimensions were defined:

dim_apps

Describes each application available in the dataset.
Source: stg_playstore_apps
Includes descriptive attributes such as:

app name

price

installs

catalog rating

ratings count

This dimension also includes surrogate keys and references to developer and category.

dim_developers

Provides context about the developer responsible for each application.
Source: stg_playstore_apps

dim_categories

Represents the application category hierarchy.
Source: stg_playstore_apps

dim_date

A conformed date dimension enabling time-based analysis.
Generated from review timestamps.

Attributes include:

date_key (YYYYMMDD format)

year

month

quarter

day_of_week

is_weekend

This allows consistent time aggregations across dashboards.

4. Identified Facts

The measurable attributes related to the review event are:

rating → can be averaged

thumbs_up_count → can be summed

review_count → can be counted

These measures allow analysis such as:

Average rating per app

Review volume by month

Developer performance comparison

5. Bus Matrix
Business Process	dim_apps	dim_developers	dim_categories	dim_date
Reviews	✔	✔	✔	✔

All review events can be analyzed through these four dimensions.

6. Star Schema Design

The final star schema consists of:

One central fact table: fact_reviews

Four dimension tables:

dim_apps

dim_developers

dim_categories

dim_date

The fact table contains foreign keys referencing each dimension and respects the declared grain.

7. Incremental Loading

The fact_reviews model was configured as an incremental model using review_id as a unique key.

On the first run, the full dataset is loaded.
On subsequent runs, only new reviews are inserted, avoiding full table recomputation.

This improves performance and ensures idempotent execution of the pipeline.

8. Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD Type 2)

To preserve historical changes in application attributes (e.g., category or price updates), a snapshot was implemented on dim_apps using dbt’s check strategy.

The snapshot creates:

dbt_valid_from

dbt_valid_to

This allows tracking multiple versions of the same application over time.

An additional dimensional model (dim_apps_scd) can be built on top of the snapshot to expose historical records for analytical purposes.

9. Validation Against Analytical Needs

The model allows answering analytical questions such as:

What is the monthly trend of average rating?

Which developer has the highest average review score?

How many reviews were submitted per category?

How do weekend reviews differ from weekday reviews?

All aggregations can be expressed as groupings on the fact table using the available dimensions.

The declared grain is respected across all joins, and referential integrity is enforced using dbt tests.
